# Data Visualization and Modeling Examples Repository

Welcome to the Data Visualization and Modeling Examples Repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks showcasing various data visualizations and models.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different data visualization techniques and modeling approaches. Each notebook is self-contained and provides step-by-step explanations and code examples.

## Usage

To explore the notebooks and run the code examples locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-visualization-examples.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the `/notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook using Jupyter.

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to understand the visualization techniques and models presented. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different datasets to enhance your understanding.

5. Remember to save any modifications you make to the notebooks before closing them.
